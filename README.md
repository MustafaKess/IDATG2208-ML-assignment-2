To do list:

Q3: 

- Understand the plot in Q3.2 -> DONE -> explained what a ROC curve is and what a RBF SVM is
- Do Q3.3 by messing around with C in SVM 
- Do Q3.4 by messing around with γ-values in SVM 

Q4: Whole thing is just a comparison between SVM and Decision Tree model behaviors

- Q4.1: Compare results from the training and validation sets from the two models 
- Q4.2: Trade offs between usability and accuracy  (Look at Fβ score metrics)
- Q4.3: GridSearchCV for hypertuning parameters for both Decicion trees and SVMs
- Q4.4: Compare accuracy between DT and SVMs
- Q4.5: Yap-session
