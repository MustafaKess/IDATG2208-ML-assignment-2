# IDATG2208 Machine Learning Assignment 2

Machine learning exercises using the Breast Cancer Winconsin dataset. This time focus on Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

The dataset is available directly in scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) and also on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). 


- **Exercise 1**: Data preparation, analysis & Standarization 


- **Exercise 2**: Decision Trees with variyng max_depth parameters and different min_samples_leaf values


- **Exercise 3**: Support Vector Machines with both a linear kernal and also a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.


- **Exercise 4**: Model comparison inbetween the SVM and DT models, GridSearchSV for hyperparameter tuning

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, scipy (used for interpolation in ROC curves)

You can install all dependencies using pip:
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib scipy`
